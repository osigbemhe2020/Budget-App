# Budget-App
the budget app is a finiacial tool used to plan your montly expenditures and income,The Budget-App enables users to track their expenses and incomes — allowing them to add entries (expense or income), view a list of transactions, and see their current balance.  
It’s built purely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks or backend required.  
This project is ideal for demonstrating fundamental front-end skills, DOM manipulation, event handling, and simple state management in JavaScript.

## Technolgies used
* HTML
* Vanila CSS
* Vanila Javascript
* Local storage

## Key Components
its one of my first portfolio projects its has five components which include:
- Budget
- Income
- Savings
- Expenses
- Debt

### INCOME- 
this is where you setup your income thich will serve as an input for the budget calculations
this section is made up of the income list and the total income

### Saving- 
this is a some that will be deducted into a seperated savings account it also serves as input for the budget calculations
this section is made up of the savings percentage and time you want this money to be realeased

### Budget- 
this is where the calculations of the savings input and income input are done to give us a budget where our expenses will be deducted from it consits of 
* current income
* savings deductions
* freed up savings
* intrest payments
* balance brought forward
*and total budget

### Expenses- 
consists of the list of goods and servies we want to purchase for the month
it consist of the expense list, popular items, expense input  and inflation calculator

### debt
debt is active when the expenses surpass the budget

## key features
- Add income or expense entries with description, amount, and type (income/expense)  
- Display list of all transactions (income and expenses)  
- Calculate and display current balance (total income − total expenses) 
- Save transactions to browser local storage so data persists across page reloads  
- ability to remove or edit past transactions  
- Responsive layout — works on desktop and mobile  
- Minimal UI and styling with pure HTML/CSS  
- Pure vanilla JS — no external dependencies  

##  What I Learned / What is the aim of the project

- DOM manipulation (reading/writing HTML elements, updating UI in response to user actions)  
- Managing simple application state in JavaScript (list of transactions, total income/expense, balance)  
- how to use functions effectively for example the percentage function 
- Basic form handling and validation (e.g. reading user input, ensuring amount is valid)

##  Possible Improvements / Future Enhancements
- Add categories (e.g. “Food”, “Transport”, “Savings”) and filter by category  
- Add charts/graphs to visualize income vs expenses over time  
- Add date/time for each transaction  
- Improve UI/UX (animations, themes/dark mode, mobile layout)  
- Add a backend to replace the localstorage
- Add inflation logic
